# The "cheap" check measures what capture adds, not Node's start

**Date:** 2026-10-30, by the thread fixing main's red ci, on the person's standing instruction to decide two-way doors
and not wait.

**What broke.** obs-live-capture's Expect `cheap` says "Capture adds at most 50 ms median and 200 ms at the 95th
percentile per tool call", and `verify/obs-live-capture/capture.test.mjs` checked it as the median of the fixture
run's `hook.run` `ms` against 50. On GitHub's runners that median came out at 53 ms (main run 41108650474 at 8d508c9,
and the obs-refusal-log merge run 41106743849), so ci went red on main and on every PR.

**What was measured** (this container, Node 22.22, 5 fixture passes, 70 hook runs each):

- Refusal-log (PR #29) did not slow the hook. At b1d8df6, before it merged, and at main the median was the same,
  36 to 39 ms either way.
- `hook.run` `ms` is `performance.now()` at the end of the hook, so it counts from the process's start. A bare
  `node` that only prints `performance.now()` takes a median 19 ms here, and an empty ES module 24 ms wall. Capture's
  own part is the other 18 ms or so: about 10 ms loading its modules and 8 ms of reads and appends.
- Nothing in that part is one big cost. Loading builtins without their ES module facade
  (`process.getBuiltinModule`), reading the marker, stdin and the journal library in parallel, and switching each
  file over moved the median by 1 to 2 ms, inside the run-to-run noise. So the hook is not made cheaper here: there
  was nothing real to cut, and a change that saves nothing would only cost a new verification for show.
- The runner is slower than this container across the board (Node's own start included), which is the 53 ms.

**Choice:** the verifier's test measures what the Expect line says capture *adds*: the median `hook.run` `ms` minus
the median start of a bare `node` measured the same way, on the same machine, in the same test, must be at most
50 ms. The 95th percentile stays an absolute 200 ms on the raw `ms`, so a slow outlier still fails. The Expect line
and the item head do not change; only the test's reading of "adds" does, and it is redone by a verifier, with a new
verdict, in the same PR.

**Why not raise the threshold?** A higher absolute number still mixes Node's start with capture's work, so it goes
red on a slower runner and hides a slower capture on a faster one. Subtracting the baseline tracks capture's own cost
on any machine.

**What it costs:** the bar is looser on a slow runner than the old absolute one (about 18 ms of capture work against
50, instead of about 38 ms total against 50). Tool-call capture runs async (plan/decisions/2026-10-30-capture-by-hooks.md),
and the obs-live-capture verifier measured 610 ms against 606 ms per call with and without the plugin, so the time a
call actually waits was never near the limit. Reversible: the test can go back to the absolute bar at any time.
