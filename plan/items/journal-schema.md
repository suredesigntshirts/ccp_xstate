## Notes

Only external inputs and observations are journalled: tool calls, completions, wakes, taps, CI results. Nothing an
agent says about itself becomes a row (ledger L-agents-self-report). The engine's own transitions arrive in stage 3
as rows of kind `engine.transition` with the transition id recorded at write time (ledger L-record-route-at-write).

## Verifier brief

Run the package tests. Write your own two-writer stress test (100 rows each, at once) on a temp folder and confirm
no torn line. Hand-write an old-version row and confirm read() upcasts it without touching the file. Verdict per
Expect id.
