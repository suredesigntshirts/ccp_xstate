## Verifier brief

Run the data-layer tests. Read the published page back with the Artifact tool and compare it with the built file and
its declared capabilities. Open that file in Chromium with a stand-in viewer serving a copy of the project's journal,
append a row, press Refresh, and confirm the release, newest row time and a new page.refresh row. Compare three
numbers on the page with the derived views computed by hand. Verdict per Expect id. A real viewer's refresh is the
person's after-landing step, read back with ArtifactData.
