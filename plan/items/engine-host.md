## How wakes reach the host

The item's owner thread subscribes to its PR's activity when the builder opens the PR, and sets its own timers with
send_later. Card taps arrive in the thread that posted the card, which is the owner. So every wake for an item arrives
in one thread, and that thread's session is the only writer of the item's journal file. Restore reads that one file
by its known path, never a folder (ledger L-library-mount-slow).

## Verifier brief

Read the six cases named above first. Write your own test for each from the case text, against the host's public
functions, and run them. Then replay a recorded item journal and compare hashes. Verdict per Expect id.
