## Verifier brief

Run the tests. Then start a real headless session (`claude -p --plugin-dir plugins/harness`) against a temp installed
project and read the two rows it wrote. Break one check on purpose (remove the marker's journal folder permission)
and confirm the row and the sentence name it. Verdict per Expect id.
