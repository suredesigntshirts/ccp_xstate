## Verifier brief

Write your own tests for case C-stand-in-picks-legal-event from its text, against `bin/host.js answer` on items you
record yourself: an illegal choice, a missing or expired grant, a grant for another repo or ask, and a legal answer.
Check the accepted answer's journal row names the grant and the session. Then do one fresh scratch run from an
existing issue with `toy-run.sh run --issue`, answer its ask with `toy-run.sh answer`, and read the merge sha on
GitHub against the verdict's sha. Verdict per Expect id.
