## Verifier brief

Read C-two-hosts-one-item in plan/cases/work-item.md and write your own test from it, without reading the builder's:
an item owned by one session with an effect open (a card not yet up), then another session's host restored and
offered a wake and an empty offer, with handlers that count every start; confirm none runs and the item's file is
unchanged, and that the owner's host then runs the open effect once. Run packages/engine/test/parity/ and confirm the
case's test passes, its gaps.json entry and verify/parity-cases/C-two-hosts-one-item.gap.test.mjs are gone. Break the
owner check in host.js and show the builder's owner-runs test or yours going red. Do the mount check with bin/host.js
under /mnt/project-files with two real session ids. Read the ci check at the head sha. Verdict per Expect id.
