## Why first

v1's host design depended on a mod spawning workers when a wake arrives. On 28 Oct auto mode refused exactly that
on a scheduled wake, and allowed it only in a turn carrying the person's request. If that still holds under a
standing allow rule, the host can't be a mod reacting to wakes, and stage 3's design changes (fallback: the host is
a thread whose model spawns workers, prompted by the wake). Every other assumption here is cheaper to check in the
same run.

## Allow rules the person places first (plain words, for the probe only)

- "In the ccp_xstate project, the harness probe mod may start subagents with $.agent.spawn on any wake, including
  timer and GitHub event wakes, to test the platform. The project owner approved this on <date>."
- "Running `claude -p --plugin-dir probes/platform` for headless probe runs is allowed."

- "In the ccp_xstate project, the harness probe may merge pull requests in the scratch repo on any wake, to test
  the platform."

## Verifier brief

You check the platform-baseline report. Don't read the builder's reasoning. For each row, find its evidence in the
probe log and fixtures, and confirm they show what the row claims. Rerun the probes that don't need a platform wake
(headless spawn, cwd, page read) with the commands in `probes/platform/README.md`. For the wake rows, confirm from the
recorded wake envelopes that no person message was in the turn. Write a verdict listing each Expect id as MET, NOT MET
or UNCLEAR, with the evidence line.
