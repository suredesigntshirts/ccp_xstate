## Verifier brief

Check out the PR head. Run `npm test` and `node plan/check.mjs`. Open the test PRs named in the Expect lines
yourself (no verdict, a verdict missing one id, a verdict from the builder's session, a softened Expect line, a TODO)
and confirm each is red for the stated reason, then confirm the PR's own run is green. Check every path named in
CLAUDE.md exists. Write verify/repo-skeleton/verdict.json in your own commit.
