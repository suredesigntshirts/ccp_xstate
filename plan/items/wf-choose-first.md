## Recommendation (prepared for the card)

- First workflow: **quick-fix** (build, verify, merge). It is the smallest that still has a separate verifier.
- Changing workflows: **describe the change**, and a thread edits the file, runs the schema check and shows the diff.
  Direct editing stays possible.
- Agree "done" first: **only in feature and long-build**. It costs a round, and quick fixes don't need it.
