## Verifier brief

Before reading the retro, recompute tokens, time by kind, rounds, refusals and person asks for the item from the
journal yourself, and compare with the retro's numbers and the derived views. Any number off by more than 5% is NOT
MET. Then check every lesson has a ledger row, every s4b-widen item's why cites a retro finding (or it is parked with
a reason), and run `node plan/check.mjs`. Write verify/retro-first-item/verdict.json in your own commit.
