// The stage record (stage-contract cleanup, item F): for every model-stage run, runs/<n>.<actor>/stage.json says what
// went in and where it came from, and, once the item takes the run's result, what came out and where it went.
//
//   started:  the stage, its workflow (id, name and hash), the invoke and state that started it, the prompt as its
//             parts (stages.js sections: every piece with its source; a frame piece says fixed: true, or filled: the
//             run facts it was filled from; an input piece names its meaningAt and producer) and every input with its
//             meaning, meaningAt, value, the context path the invoke read it from and its producer;
//   finished: the transition, event and state (a list of active states, each a dotted path) that took the result,
//             then the output (or error) with stamped (the dotted paths in it the host wrote, not the agent), each
//             context path the transition wrote from it, with into (the state entered, a dotted path), replaced (the
//             producer of the value it replaced, or null over a default) and readBy (the invokes that could read it).
//
// A producer is the last write to the path an input reads (or to a whole that holds it): the run and output field of
// the stage that returned it ({ kind: 'stage', run, actor, field }), a child workflow or host effect likewise, the
// item's input ({ kind: 'initial', field }), a literal in the workflow ({ kind: 'literal', at }), an outside event
// ({ kind: 'event', event, source, field }), a copy of another path ({ kind: 'copy', from, of }), the host for a field
// it stamps on a ref a run returned ({ kind: 'host', stamped, run, actor, field }), or the context default
// ({ kind: 'default', at }). Later writes to parts of the path are listed as amended; when the base is a null default,
// the value is made of those parts alone, and the producer is { kind: 'parts', default, parts: [{ path, ...writer }] },
// the parts listed there once and not again as amended.
// readBy lists the invokes that could read a written path next (any invoke reading it that the item can reach from
// the state the write entered, by any path in the chart, taken or not), not the one that will: a later write may
// replace the value first, as replanning nulls verdict before awaitingMerge can be reached again. A reader that is
// the writing invoke itself (its state entered again, as the next build reads this build's pr as previous) is kept
// and marked self: true. A run whose state was left before it returned (its stop) ends with finished.stopped and no
// output. Every write is in the journal: the host puts each applied transition's writes in its engine.transition row
// (host.js writesOf), so the record is derived from the journal and the workflow JSON alone. Nothing here imports
// XState.
