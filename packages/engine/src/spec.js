// Turns a machine spec (spec/*.machine.json) into an XState machine. The JSON is plain XState config plus
// four small conventions, and this file is the whole interpreter for them:
//
// - Paths. A string like "context.pr.headSha" or "event.output" reads from { context, event };
//   { "value": x } is the literal x. Invoke input and the root output map names to paths.
// - Context op. Actions are { type: "set", params: { "<context path>": <path or value> } }. Every source in one
//   set reads the context as it was before that set, so { b: "context.a", a: x } shifts a into b (design A,
//   round 2: a bounded loop is a short shift register, and `inc` is gone). Nothing else writes context.
// - Guards. meta.guards names lists of conditions that must all hold: a path that must be present,
//   { path, is: literal }, { path, in: [literals] }, { path, same: otherPath } or { path, below: number }.
// - Needs. A state's meta.needs names the guards that must hold to enter it. Every transition into the
//   state checks them, together with its own guard, against the context as the transition's actions
//   leave it. So no state is ever entered without what it needs, and the JSON says what that is.
// - Wrote marks. Every set action is followed by a `wrote` marker carrying its params and its JSON pointer in the
//   workflow file. XState runs assign actions inside transition() and does not return them; the marker is how the
//   host learns which context paths a step wrote and from where, and journals them (stage-contract cleanup, item F).
